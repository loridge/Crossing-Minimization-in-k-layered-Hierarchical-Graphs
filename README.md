# Crossing-Minimization-in-k-layered-Hierarchical-Graphs

A project for CS 198/199 under the Algorithms and Complexity Laboratory - UP Diliman




File naming convention:
- snake case (e.g. crossing_util.py, cross.py)

Element naming conventions:
- variables, package names, functions: snake_case
- classes: CamelCase
- constants: UPPERCASE

the rest are scratch files or whatnot,

## Major Bugs: 
-  verify behavior of code because Python is neither pass-by-value nor pass-by-reference
- N/A

# Dataset used
- the dataset used is made by Bartolomeo et al. https://osf.io/preprints/osf/qdyt9
